Data Analytics Learning Repository
Welcome to my data analytics learning repository! Here, you will find a collection of projects that I have worked on to learn and explore more about data analytics.

As a beginner in the field, these projects serve as a way for me to apply the concepts and techniques that I have learned, and to gain hands-on experience with real-world data. Each project includes a brief description of the problem or question being addressed, the data used, the techniques and tools applied, and the results and conclusions.

Project List
Project 1: Exploring Wine Dataset: This project explores a dataset of wine and finds correlation between its ingredients. The goal is to gain a better understanding of the factors that contribute to the taste and quality of wine, and to potentially identify opportunities for improvement in the production process.

Project 2: Exploring Housing Dataset : This project focused on cleaning and preparing a dataset of housing prices for further analysis. The data was imported into MS SQL database and various cleaning techniques were applied to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data. The cleaned dataset was then ready for further analysis to identify patterns and trends in the housing market.

Project 3: Data cleaning and exploration of COVID-19 : This project involved cleaning and exploring a dataset of COVID-19 cases and deaths. The data was collected from various sources and cleaned to ensure accuracy. The cleaned data was then used to create a Tableau dashboard to visualize the spread of the virus and identify patterns and trends in the data.

Project 4 : Data cleaning and exploration of Covid - 19 (INDIA) : Similar to project 3, this project also involved cleaning and exploring a dataset of COVID-19 cases and deaths in India. The data was collected from various sources and cleaned to ensure accuracy. The cleaned data was then used to create a Tableau dashboard to visualize the spread of the virus in India and identify patterns and trends in the data.

Project 5: Exploration of a Movie dataset : This project involved exploring a dataset of movies and finding correlation between various attributes. The data was collected from various sources and cleaned to ensure accuracy. The dataset was then analyzed using Jupyter Notebook and various statistical analysis was performed to identify patterns and relationships between the various attributes in the movies dataset. The findings were then presented in a clear and concise manner, including relevant charts and tables to support the conclusions. The goal of the project was to gain a better understanding of the factors that contribute to the success of a movie.
